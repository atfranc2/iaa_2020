## Assignment #1 - SQL and NoSQL Distrubuted Databases

I'd prefer for you to answer these questions using Google BigQuery. If that doesn't work for you, then you may using either Apache Hive or SparkSQL.
Use the Austin Bikesharing data to answer the following questions. There are two ways to access the data:

**Option #1 to Access the Data**: Download the files from here [bikesharing_trips.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaratsian/iaa_2020/master/data/bikeshare_trips.csv) and [bikesharing_stations.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaratsian/iaa_2020/master/data/bikeshare_stations.csv)

**Option #2 to Access the Data**: You can query the data directly in Google Cloud BigQuery using a syntax such as this:

```
SELECT * FROM `bigquery-public-data.austin_bikeshare.bikeshare_stations` LIMIT 1000
```

# **Questions:**

1. Which bike station in Austin is the most popular when starting a trip?

2. Which routes (start to end point) are the most popular. Please list the top 5. A route is a defined as a (start_station_name, end_station_name).

3. Which stations are the furthest distance apart? Hint: I'd calculated the distance in meters based on the longitue and latitute of the start and end points ([reference](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/geography_functions))
